## Ordine functional mobile app

Transformed a high-fidelity prototype mobile app, ‘Ordine’, into a fully 
functional cross-platform application using React Native, Expo Router, and 
Supabase for authentication and storage.

Learned the fundamentals of react native and mobile development and how to use emulators and Expo Go to test the app in virtual and real devices.
